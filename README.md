# Sparta global User Movie Director Relationship

For this project I created a rails project with three resources (Users, Directors, Movies). I created all three of these resources using the generate scaffold command. Once these are created I than append the models to include has_many and :through commands. I also included at least 3 different attributes for each resource. And finally I added 3 validates for each model.
